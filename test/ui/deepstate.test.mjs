/**
 * The Deepstate venue on Robinhood Chain.
 *
 * DEEP's only market is Deepstate's order book - there is no AMM pool for it
 * anywhere - so before this path existed the page priced it at nothing and a
 * user picking it got "no route" for a token that trades. `DeepstateQuoteLens`
 * prices the book in one `view` call, and these tests cover the two things that
 * can still go wrong after a correct quote:
 *
 *   - the quote is right but never competes, so the venue is invisible; and
 *   - the quote is right, wins, and the calldata built from it names a
 *     different trade than the one that was priced.
 *
 * The second is the dangerous one. `swapDeep` takes the taker's packed order
 * word, and a bid's quantity is the base to MATCH with the fee taken afterwards
 * - so a caller that rebuilds that word from `amountOut` is taxed twice and
 * silently under-delivers. The lens returns the exact word it priced; this
 * asserts the page forwards that word rather than reconstructing one.
