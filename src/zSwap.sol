/// @title zSwap v0.3
/// @notice Permanently-deployed onchain HTML swap dapp for Ethereum mainnet.
/// @dev Architecture: the HTML payload (440972 B) is the runtime bytecode of
///      17 data contracts, deployed separately and passed to the constructor.
///      html() reassembles them via EXTCODECOPY with proper ABI encoding
///      (offset + length + padded data) so any RPC client decodes directly.
///      request() implements ERC-5219 for first-class web3:// gateway
///      compatibility (ERC-4804). Splitting the page across 19 data contracts
///      means EIP-170 caps each chunk, not the dapp
///      (24576 B per chunk, 25972 B headroom).
///
///      The chunk count is fixed in the constructor arity and the page is
///      immutable, so it is sized to ceil(len/17) with headroom for a release
///      of growth. It cannot be padded arbitrarily: every chunk must be
///      non-empty and distinct (see the constructor), so ceil(len/17) must
///      stay under EIP-170 while len/17 stays non-zero. The page is stored
///      stripped of comments and indentation - every byte is paid for on
///      chain, forever, by whoever deploys the next version.
///
/// HOW TO READ THE DAPP
///   cast call <addr> "html()(string)" --rpc-url <rpc> > zSwap.html
///   # then open zSwap.html in any browser
///
/// HOW TO BROWSE THE DAPP
///   - Via an ERC-4804 web3:// HTTP gateway, e.g.:
///       https://<addr>.1.w3link.io/
///   - Via a w4eth gateway. ERC-8244 resolves any contract exposing html()
///     directly as a web page, which this contract does, so no ERC-5219
///     support is required on the gateway side:
///       https://<addr>.w4eth.io/
///     e.g. https://0x000000006513b7821171c8447ec7ecdfa3b956fd.w4eth.io/
///   - Via a wallet/browser with web3:// protocol support (e.g. the
///     Web3URL Browser Extension on Chrome/Firefox/Brave).
///   - Or via the "HOW TO READ THE DAPP" path above.
///
/// HOW TO REGENERATE FROM zSwap.html
///   node script/build-zSwap.mjs             (size natspec, READMEs, test pins)
///   node script/build-zSwap-chunks.mjs      (per-chunk deployable initcode)
///   node script/build-zSwapRegistry-call.mjs (registry calldata embeds the page)
///   node script/check-zSwap.mjs             (syntax, ids, decoder vs fixtures)
///   forge test --match-path "test/zSwap*"
///   Skipping the third step leaves script/zSwapRegistry-*.calldata.txt pinned
///   to a stale page; test/zSwapRegistry.t.sol fails on exactly that.
///
/// HOW TO USE THE DAPP (in browser)
///   1. Connect a wallet (MetaMask, Rabby, etc.) on Ethereum mainnet.
///   2. Pick "from" and "to" tokens; type an amount in either field.
///   3. Review the rate line: rate, source DEX, and Min received / Max paid.
///   4. Click Swap. ERC-20 inputs trigger an exact-amount approval first.
///   The page follows the OS light/dark setting; the toggle beside the address
///   overrides it and the choice persists in localStorage.
///
/// NAMES
///   The recipient field accepts a raw 0x address or a name. Forward resolution
///   picks the registry by suffix: .wei -> WNS, .gwei -> GNS (a WNS NameNFT
///   fork, same interface), .eth -> ENS. An unregistered name resolves to the
///   zero address and is refused rather than used, and the resolved address is
///   shown under the field so the destination is visible before signing.
///   The connected wallet is shown by reverse resolution in the order
///   WNS -> GNS -> ENS, falling back to the shortened hex address.
///
/// SEND
///   A second tab performs a plain transfer: native ETH by value, or an ERC-20
///   via transfer(to, amount). No router, no quoter, and no approval of any
///   kind is involved - the tokens move directly from the user to the
///   recipient. It shares the pay panel, balance, MAX, custom-token import and
///   name resolution with the swap tab rather than duplicating them.
///
///   A send cannot be undone, so the confirm button is labelled with the
///   amount, symbol and RESOLVED destination, and stays disabled until the
///   recipient resolves to a non-zero address. The recipient is resolved a
///   second time at click time and the send aborts if it no longer matches
///   what the button showed, in case the field was edited or the name
///   re-pointed after the last keystroke.
///
/// SLOW
///   The send tab can route through SLOW, the time-lock escrow at
///   0x000000006513B7821171C8447ec7ECdfa3b956Fd, by picking a delay. The
///   sender may reverse the transfer at any point before it matures; after
///   maturity the recipient claims it.
///
///   The same bytecode sits at that address on Ethereum, Base and Robinhood, so
///   the delay is offered on every chain the page serves rather than on mainnet
///   alone. Positions do not travel: they belong to the chain they were made
///   on, which is why the list is re-read on a chain switch.
///
///   What does not travel is the keeper. SLOW's tip gate is deployed on all
///   three, but only mainnet has a bot claiming from it, and a tip nobody will
///   collect is worse for the sender than no tip - so auto-claim is offered on
///   mainnet only. That is one flag, `slowTip`, in the chain table.
///
///   The panel is deliberately the common half of SLOW. Guardians, per-token
///   balances and the full history live on SLOW's own page, which SLOW serves
///   from its own bytes exactly as this contract serves this one; the send tab
///   links out to it through the same gateway convention, carrying the chain,
///   asset, amount, recipient and delay already typed here.
///
///   Positions are listed by reading the contract directly -
///   getOutboundTransfers / getInboundTransfers give the ids, pendingTransfers
///   gives each one's state, and a zero timestamp means already settled. No
///   indexer, no backend and no event log is involved, which is what makes the
///   view possible from a page that can never be updated.
///
///   A SLOW id packs its token and delay as token | delay<<160, so rows are
///   decoded in the page rather than costing one decodeId() call each. This
///   was checked against the contract's own decodeId() before being relied on.
///
///   SLOW takes a real ERC-20 allowance; there is no permit shortcut, and the
///   temptation to add one should be resisted. Two facts from the verified
///   source rule it out. First, SLOW exposes no permit entry point, and its
///   multicall(bytes[]) is Solady's delegatecall-to-self, so every batched
///   entry must be one of SLOW's own functions - a token permit() is a call to
///   the token, so it can never be an element. (zRouter differs precisely
///   because it carries an explicit permit forwarder.) Second, the deposit path
///   calls token.safeTransferFrom, not Solady's safeTransferFrom2, so there is
///   no Permit2 fallback: a Permit2 allowance alone will not fund a deposit.
///   multicall also reverts on non-zero msg.value, so it cannot carry ETH.
///   The ERC-20 path is therefore approve(exact) then depositTo, collapsed into
///   one confirmation by EIP-5792 where the wallet supports it.
///
///   The four quoter builders are called concurrently rather than in series:
///   they are heavy multi-pool reads, and sequencing them cost four round
///   trips per quote (measured 4.6s vs 0.8s against a public RPC).
///
///   claim() pays the recipient directly, but reverse() does NOT pay the
///   sender - it only credits unlockedBalances. Verified on a mainnet fork:
///   reverse alone settles the position and returns nothing, stranding the
///   funds inside SLOW. The Reverse action therefore sends
///   multicall([reverse, withdrawFrom]) in one transaction.
///
///   Two details of depositTo are easy to get wrong and are worth stating:
///   for native ETH the amount argument MUST be zero and the value is taken
///   from msg.value, while an ERC-20 passes the amount and no value and must
///   be approved to SLOW first (exact amount, batched via EIP-5792 when the
///   wallet supports it). Keeper tips, auto-claim, guardians and the post-grace
///   clawback are deliberately not exposed here - they belong to the full dapp.
///
/// SHAREABLE LINKS
///   The page reads a hash fragment so a request can be sent as a link. It only
///   ever PREFILLS - nothing is auto-submitted, and the recipient is resolved
///   and displayed before signing exactly as if it had been typed:
///     #to=alice.wei&amount=10&token=USDC          request a payment
///     #to=alice.wei&amount=1&token=ETH&lock=1d    request it time-locked
///     #token=ETH&out=USDC&amount=500&exactOut=1   "pay me 500 USDC, spend ETH"
///   token/out take a symbol or a 0x address (imported on demand). lock takes
///   seconds or 30m/1h/1d/1w and rounds UP to an offered option, so a link can
///   never quietly produce a shorter lock than it asked for. An unparseable
///   lock is ignored rather than guessed at.
///
///   A token named by a link is imported for the session only - it is never
///   written to the saved list, because symbol() is attacker-chosen and a URL
///   must not be able to plant a permanent "USDC" entry in someone's tokens.
///   Any imported symbol that collides with one already present is suffixed
///   with its address so two entries can never look identical.
///
///   The inverse is available in the page: the link control beside the theme
///   toggle turns whatever is on screen back into one of these URLs and copies
///   it, so a request can be shared without knowing the syntax. A custom token
///   whose symbol was disambiguated carries a space, so those emit the address
///   instead of a symbol the reader could not resolve.
///
/// APPROVALS
///   ERC-20 input never asks for an unlimited allowance. The dapp walks a
///   ladder and uses the best option the token and wallet support:
///     1. EIP-2612 permit  - sign offchain, prepended to the router multicall.
///        One signature, one transaction. The EIP-712 domain version differs
///        per token (USDC is "2", wstETH and BOLD are "1") and many tokens do
///        not expose version(), so the correct one is found by matching the
///        computed domain separator against the token's DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()
///        rather than guessed.
///     2. Permit2 - when the user already approved Permit2 for this token.
///        zRouter.permit2TransferFrom pulls the funds and calls depositFor(),
///        marking the transient balance the swap legs consume, so the quoter's
///        calldata is used unchanged.
///     3. EIP-5792 - no permit available, but the wallet can batch atomically:
///        approve(exact) and swap in a single confirmation.
///     4. Otherwise approve(exact) then swap as separate transactions, with a
///        preceding approve(0) for tokens that require it.
///   Every tier approves only the amount being swapped.
///
/// QUOTING
///   The quoter exposes several builders and this dapp compares them rather
///   than taking the first that succeeds: single-hop/2-hop-hub, 3-hop, and (for
///   exact-in) the split and hybrid-split builders. Comparing matters — a 2-hop
///   route that merely succeeds can be far worse than a 3-hop one, e.g.
///   BOLD->rETH priced ~$28 through a skewed V4 pool where 3-hop gave ~$36.

    // ------------------------------------------------------------- LINEAGE
    //
    // `html()` is immutable and stays that way. The successor below is a CLAIM
    // ABOUT LINEAGE, never a redirect: this contract serves its own nineteen chunks
    // forever, whatever the DAO deploys later. Making `html()` forward to a
    // successor would have been the smaller change and it would have cost the
    // one property this design exists for - an address whose bytes cannot move
    // under an auditor, a bookmark, or a gateway cache that was told the answer
    // is `immutable`. Mutability belongs in the naming layer, where an ENS
    // contenthash can point wherever the DAO wants and everybody already
    // expects the target to change.
    //
    // A client wanting the newest build walks `successor` until it reaches
    // zero. A client wanting the bytes it audited stops where it is.
    //
    // THE PAGE IS ONE OF THOSE CLIENTS. A pointer nobody reads moves nobody:
    // for the whole of v0.1 the chain could have carried three successors and
    // every open tab would have said nothing. So the served page calls
    // `latest()` on its own address - taken from the GATEWAY HOSTNAME, which
    // is the only place it can come from: a page that writes its own address
    // into itself changes the chunks the address is derived from, and no salt
    // solves that fixpoint. So this notice exists for readers on a web3://
    // gateway, and a file opened from disk simply does not get it. If the tip
    // is not itself, the page
    // puts a "newer" link in the footer beside the address. It SAYS, it does
    // not send: no redirect, no auto-navigation, no rewriting of what is on
    // screen. The bytes stay the bytes that were audited and leaving them is
    // the reader's decision. The read is a plain `eth_call` through the
    // wallet's RPC, so it needs no account and no permission, and every
    // failure - no wallet, another chain, an RPC that will not answer - is
    // silent, because a missing notice is a smaller harm than a wrong one.

    ///      this value alone, the successor check demands the same one back,
