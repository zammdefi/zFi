# slow-keeper

Settles expired **tipped** SLOW transfers through `SLOWGate` and collects the relayer tip.

- `SLOW` — [0x000000006513b7821171c8447ec7ecdfa3b956fd](https://etherscan.io/address/0x000000006513b7821171c8447ec7ecdfa3b956fd)
- `SLOWGate` — [0x76D1956b3BE7c0D09A16dE00DcE9B6f54ef28D34](https://etherscan.io/address/0x76D1956b3BE7c0D09A16dE00DcE9B6f54ef28D34)

Ethereum mainnet only. SLOW itself is at the same address on Base (8453) and Robinhood
(4663), and the gate is deployed there too, so a second instance pointed at either
chain would work - but nothing runs there yet, which is why zSwap only offers the
tip on mainnet. Point a copy at an L2 before flipping that flag, not after.

## How it earns

`SLOW.depositToWithTip` posts an ETH tip on the gate alongside a timelocked transfer.
Once the timelock expires, anyone can call `gate.claim(transferId)`: the gate routes
`slow.claimTipped`, the underlying is paid to the transfer's recipient, and the tip is
forwarded to `msg.sender`. That tip is the only revenue — untipped transfers pay nothing.

A claim is only valid when **both** hold at send time:

1. `block.timestamp >= pt.timestamp + delay` (delay is packed above the token address in the id).
2. `guardians[pt.to] == address(0)` — `_doClaim` reverts `ClaimBlockedByGuardian` otherwise.

Condition 2 can flip in either direction *after* the tip is posted, so the bot re-checks
it every pass rather than caching it.

## Design notes

**No database.** State is rebuilt from `TipPosted` logs at boot and reconciled against
`slow.pendingTransfers` via multicall. `pendingTransfers` is deleted on every settlement
path, so `timestamp == 0` means the tip is gone — claimed by another keeper, or the
transfer was reversed/clawed back and the tip is now the depositor's to refund. A full
re-read runs every 25 passes to evict those.

**Flashbots Protect.** `gate.claim` is a first-come-first-served race with other keepers.
Submitting through Flashbots Protect keeps the claim out of the public mempool and, more
importantly, means a lost race is dropped rather than landing as a paid revert. A send
that never gets included simply requeues.

**Atomic batches.** `claimMany` reverts entirely on the first bad id. The bot simulates
the exact batch via `eth_estimateGas` immediately before signing, and on failure splits to
per-id simulation so one stale entry can't block the rest.

**Profit gate.** Claims only when `tip >= gas * (baseFee + priorityFee) * MARGIN_MULTIPLE`.
The margin absorbs basefee movement between simulation and inclusion.

**RPC failover, pooled by role.** Endpoints are not interchangeable, so they are not
round-robined as one list. Probed 2026-08-03 against this exact workload:

| endpoint | `getLogs` range | state reads |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rpc.mevblocker.io` (+`/fast`) | unlimited | ok |
| `eth.api.onfinality.io/public` | unlimited | ok |
| `gateway.tenderly.co/public/mainnet` | unlimited | ok |
| `eth.drpc.org` | 10,000 | ok (throttles `estimateGas`) |
| `eth-pokt.nodies.app`, `1rpc.io/eth` | 50 | ok |
| `eth.blockrazor.xyz` | 25 | ok |
| `eth-mainnet.public.blastapi.io` | 10 | ok |
| `ethereum-rpc.publicnode.com` | archive-gated | ok |
| `eth.rpc.blxrbdn.com` | unavailable | ok |

**Every one of these is keyless.** Three independent operators serve the full range, which
is what lets the bot run with no account anywhere. Rejected as unusable: `eth.meowrpc.com`
(no `getLogs`), `eth.public-rpc.com` and `rpc.ankr.com` (key required), `cloudflare-eth.com`,
`eth.llamarpc.com`, `rpc.payload.de`, blockpi, omniatech (dead or serving HTML).

Only the unlimited tier can serve a cold backfill. The rest still carry steady state: a
pass advances far fewer blocks than even a 10-block cap, and all of them serve
`eth_call`/Multicall3.

State reads go through viem's `fallback` transport in priority order. Log discovery uses
its own pool that *learns* each endpoint's range limit from the error text and shrinks its
window to fit, so a capped endpoint is throttled rather than discarded. Rate-limit
messages are deliberately distinguished from range-limit messages — conflating them
permanently shrinks a healthy endpoint that was briefly throttled (`test/classify.test.mjs`
pins this against the real strings each provider returns).

Backfill progress is consumed per window, so a source dying mid-scan costs only the
unscanned remainder rather than the whole pass.

**Endpoints are never logged verbatim.** Provider URLs carry the key in the path, and
anything printed lands in the host's log store and in any transcript pasted for debugging.
Only host plus a 4-character fingerprint is emitted.

**Permanent failures evict.** A single-id simulation failure is diagnosed against
`pendingTransfers` rather than guessed from the revert string — `gate.claim` on a cleared
transfer surfaces SLOW's custom `TransferDoesNotExist`, which viem renders only as
"reverted for an unknown reason". A settled id is dropped instead of being re-simulated
every pass forever.

**Sends never fall back.** Claims go to Flashbots Protect only. A public-mempool fallback
would silently invert the economics — lost races would land as paid reverts instead of
being dropped — so if Protect is unreachable the bot waits.

## Two ways to run it

**Worker** (`npm start`) — polls every 3 minutes, runs forever.

**Cron** (`npm run once`) — one pass, then exits. It also fails *loudly*: a non-zero exit
lands in the scheduler's run history, where a wedged worker just goes quiet — which at this
tip volume is indistinguishable from a healthy idle one.

Neither is in a hurry. SLOW's delays run hours to days, so claiming three minutes (or an
hour) after expiry is indistinguishable from claiming in twelve seconds, and the slower
cadence is what keeps request volume inside what free public endpoints tolerate
indefinitely. The design goal is that tips get picked up *eventually and without
supervision*, not that they get picked up fast.

**Run exactly one instance.** Two processes sharing a key will sign competing claims
against the same nonce; the relay rejects the loser with `Missing or invalid parameters`.
That is handled gracefully — nothing is spent and the ids requeue — but it wastes passes
and muddies the log.

A cron pass keeps settling while passes still produce claims, so a backlog larger than one
batch clears in a single run. Both modes are defined in `render.yaml` — run one, not both.

In worker mode a heartbeat line prints every `HEARTBEAT_EVERY` passes with the queue
shape and gas balance, so the log distinguishes idle from stuck.

## Config

| Var | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RPC_URL` | **no** | — | Optional. If set, tried first. Must allow wide `eth_getLogs` ranges. Unset is fine and fully supported — the built-in pool is keyless. |
| `RPC_URLS` | no | — | Comma-separated extras, inserted ahead of the built-in public fallbacks. |
| `RPC_URLS_STATE` / `RPC_URLS_LOGS` | no | — | Role-specific overrides for an endpoint good at only one job. |
| `PRIVATE_KEY` | yes | — | Keeper EOA. Gas float only. |
| `SEND_RPC_URL` | no | `https://rpc.flashbots.net/fast` | Send-only endpoint. |
| `MARGIN_MULTIPLE` | no | `1.25` | Required tip-to-cost ratio. |
| `PRIORITY_GWEI` | no | `0.05` | Priority fee bid. |
| `MAX_FEE_GWEI` | no | `50` | Hard ceiling on `maxFeePerGas`. |
| `MAX_BATCH` | no | `10` | Max ids per `claimMany`. |
| `LOG_CHUNK` | no | `250000` | Backfill window. Large on purpose — capped sources shrink themselves to fit. |
| `POLL_MS` | no | `180000` | Poll interval. Three minutes; see below. |
| `START_BLOCK` | no | `25913818` | SLOW's deploy block. |
| `ONE_SHOT` | no | — | `true` runs a single pass and exits (cron mode). Exit code is the liveness signal. |
| `HEARTBEAT_EVERY` | no | `20` | Passes between heartbeat lines in worker mode. `0` disables. |
| `DRY_RUN` | no | — | `true` logs decisions without sending. |

## Local run

```sh
npm install
PRIVATE_KEY=0x... npm run dry-run     # no RPC_URL needed
```

## Security

The keeper key cannot move user funds. The gate has no path to `safeTransferFrom` or
`withdrawFrom`, and `_doClaim` pins the payout to `pt.to` — the caller only ever receives
the tip. Worst case for a leaked key is loss of the ETH held for gas.
